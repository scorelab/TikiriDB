                                TikiriDB - chamin test 2
                               ==========

* Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TikiriDB is a database abstraction layer for Contiki operating system which enables 
a query interface to acquire required data in highly efficient manner. After setting 
up the sensor network with TikiriDB, it is possible to gather data without having 
the knowledge of programming sensor nodes. TikiriDB will provide a query language 
which is more similar to conventional query language with additional syntax to 
comply with sensor network environment. 

Current version of TikiriDB is only designed to run on Cooja which is the simulator 
used in Contiki operating system.

* High-Level Functional Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

End users use TikiriSQL client to send queries to the sensor network. The TikiriSQL 
client parses the entered textual SQL statements and converts them to a machine 
friendly format. Then the formated query is sent to the Serial Forwarder. The 
Serial Forwarder is an application runs on the gateway computer. It's task is to 
forward the packets received from serial line via a TCP connection and vice-versa.
Then the node connected to the gateway computer via the serial line sends received 
query to the sensor network.

When a query is received to a sensor node, the query is stored in node's memory 
and executed periodically as defined in the query. Query results are sent back to 
the query originator node on each successful execution. The TikiriSQL client 
receives these results via Serial Forwarder and displays them accordingly to the 
end user.

There are THREE main components in this package  which are required to test the application in cooja
   *. serial_forwarder 
   *. tikirisql  
   *. test-apps 

serial_forwarder: plugin for cooja is located in cooja>plugins the installation instructions 
of the plugin is illustrated bellow. This plugin will enable the connectivity of cooja simulated
environment and tikirisql.

tikirisql: the TikiriDB client which parses and validates the query and  is locate in gateway directory. 

test-apps: the testing implementations of qprodessor TikiriDB library. This will be used to 
test the functionality of the TikiriDB system.

Other components developed and under development which is required for real  deployment
   *. serial-forwarder-cpp 
   *. routing
   *. tikiriac 

serial-forwarder-cpp: provides the connectivity between real sensor network and the gateway computer (tikirisql)
through serial port. 

routing: implementing the energy efficient routing protocol

tikiriac: access control module for TikiriDB to prevent unauthorized access, control different privilege levels,
prevent node capturing attacks, ... etc. 

* Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following installation steps are for a Debian based systems(i.e: debian, ubuntu)

1. Install Cooja as explained in the steps 4 and 5 at  
   http://www.sics.se/contiki/tutorials/tutorial-installing-contiki-and-cooja-on-ubuntu-linux-8.10.html
   (Use the CVS version of Cooja)

2. Configure the serial forwarder plugin for the Cooja as follows.

   I. Copy "serial_forwarder" directory into "<Contiki Directory>/tools/cooja/apps" directory.

   II. Add the follwoing elements to the "<Contiki Directory>/tools/cooja/build.xml" file.  
       a. As a child element of <target name="clean" depends="init">, add the following
          <ant antfile="build.xml" dir="apps/serial_forwarder" target="clean" inheritAll="false"/>

       b. As a child element of <target name="jar" depends="jar_cooja"> add the following
          <ant antfile="build.xml" dir="apps/serial_forwarder" target="jar" inheritAll="false"/>
      
   III. Replace the variable "DEFAULT_PROJECTDIRS" in the file "<Contiki Directory>/tools/cooja/config/external_tools_linux.config"
        with the following
        DEFAULT_PROJECTDIRS = [CONTIKI_DIR]/tools/cooja/apps/mrm;[CONTIKI_DIR]/tools/cooja/apps/mspsim;[CONTIKI_DIR]/tools/cooja/apps/avrora;[CONTIKI_DIR]/tools/cooja/apps/serial_forwarder  

 Note: The term "<Contiki Directory>" is used to denote the directory where 
       the Contiki is installed.

3. Install additional packages that are needed to compile tikirisql(TikiriDB client).
   In the terminal type: 
   # apt-get install flex bison

4. Compile tikirisql client
   In the terminal type:
   # cd <TikiriDB directory>/gateway/tikirisql
   # make

5. Configure Contiki source
   Open the file "<TikiriDB directory>/test-apps/Makefile" with your favorite 
   text editor and set the Contiki installation directory appropriately.

* Running TikiriDB
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

For the sake of convenience, a saved Cooja simulation file can be used to test TikiriDB.
The saved  simulation files are located at <TikiriDB directory>/test-apps directory.

To run the simulation, 
In the terminal, type:
  # cd <TikiriDB directory>/test-apps
  # make test-app.csc

Or you can compile from the biginning using following commands,
  # make test-app.cooja TARGET=cooja

If everything has been configured correctly, the saved simulation will be loaded. The
Serial Forwarder dialog will be opened for node 1. Start the Serial Forwarder and
the simulation. The default port for the Serial Forwarder will be 25600 + node id.

To run tikirisql,
In the terminal, type:
  # cd cd <TikiriDB directory>/gateway/tikirisql
  # ./tikirisql -H localhost -P 25601

To get the tikirisql help use the command "\h"(without quotes) in the tsql prompt.

Example queries:
SELECT temp,humid,node FROM sensors SAMPLE PERIOD 1;
SELECT node,temp FROM sensors WHERE temp = 20 SAMPLE PERIOD 2 FOR 100;
SELECT temp,humid,node FROM sensors WHERE nodeid < 10 SAMPLE PERIOD 1 FOR 10;
SELECT node,temp FROM sensors WHERE temp <> 20 SAMPLE PERIOD 2 FOR 10;


TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Many portions of the system(i.e: protocols used) are undocumented. Therefore, a
  proper documentation has to be done.
* Port TikiriDB to run on real sensor node platforms(i.e: sky, MICAz)   
* Implementing TikiriAC access control module for TikiriDB
* Add more functionalities to tikirisql query language
* Develop friendly user interfaces for tikirisql client
* Energy efficient routing protocol for long term usage of TikiriDB
